Internship Projects at CodSoft

Welcome to my internship repository at CodSoft! During my internship, I worked on several projects aimed at enhancing my programming skills and understanding of software development concepts. Below are the projects I completed during my internship:

Number Guessing Game: A fun and interactive game where players guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, guiding them to the correct answer.
Student Grade Calculator: An application designed to calculate students grades based on their scores in various assignments, quizzes, and exams. This calculator helps educators efficiently assess student performance and track progress throughout the academic term.
ATM Interface: A simulated ATM interface that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and checking account balances. The interface provides a user-friendly experience with clear instructions for each transaction.
Quiz Application: A quiz application that presents users with a series of questions on different topics. Users can select answers from multiple choices and receive instant feedback on their responses. The application tracks users' scores and displays results at the end of the quiz.

Languages: Java programming
